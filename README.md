# interactivity-api-session

Bear in mind that, in order to use the blocks shared in this repo, you need to install the latest version of the [Gutenberg plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/). Just with that, the blocks should work as expected.

The old [Block Interactivity Experiments plugin](https://github.com/WordPress/block-interactivity-experiments/) is NOT a requirement anymore, as the code has been migrated directly to Gutenberg.
